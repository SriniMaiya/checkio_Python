#!/home/srini/anaconda3/envs/tfgpu/bin/checkio --domain=py run absolute-sorting

# Let's try some sorting. Here is an array with the specific rules.
# 
# The array        (a list)        has various numbers. You should sort it, but sort it by absolute value in ascending order.    For example, the sequence (-20, -5, 10, 15) will be sorted like so: (-5, 10, 15, -20).    Your function should return the sorted list  or tuple.
# 
# Precondition:The numbers in the array are unique by their absolute values.
# 
# Input:An array of numbers , a tuple..
# 
# Output:The list or tuple (but not a generator) sorted by absolute values in ascending order.
# 
# Addition:The results of your function will be shown as a list in the tests explanation panel.
# 
# Precondition:    len(set(abs(x) for x in array)) == len(array)
# 0 < len(array) < 100
# all(isinstance(x, int) for x in array)
# all(-100 < x < 100 for x in array)
# 
#
